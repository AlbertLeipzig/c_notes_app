## Algorithm Library

The algorithms library defines functions for a variety of purposes (e.g. searching, sorting, counting, manipulating) that operate on ranges of elements. Note that a range is defined as [first, last) where last refers to the element past the last element to inspect or modify.

## I/O Library

C++ includes the following input/output libraries: an OOP-style stream-based I/O library, print-based family of functions(since C++23), and the standard set of C-style I/O functions.

<fstream> File I/O implementation =>
<iostream> File I/O implementation => behaves as if it defines a static storage duration object of type

## Strings Library

In the C++ standard library, a character is an object which, when treated sequentially, can represent text.

The term means not only objects of character types, but also any value that can be represented by a type that provides the definitions specified in the strings library and following libraries:
<string>

## Containers Library

The Containers library is a generic collection of class templates and algorithms that allow programmers to easily implement common data structures like queues, lists and stacks

<vector>

"json.hpp" // using json = nlohmann::json;

std::array defines a type array 
::find_if() 
::ifstream

outFile.close()
.close();
j.dump(2)
.erase()
.get()
.insert()
.is_array()
.is_open()

struct
vector "no pre-defined array. Is more flexible and has a lot of built-it methods, but comes with a heap cost"

-> in std::cout << it->id << " : " << it->text << std::endl;
